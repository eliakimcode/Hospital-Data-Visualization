# Hospital-Data-Visualization

**Power BI Business Analytics Project**


**Project Overview:**
I previously worked on a Power BI project that involved analyzing business performance data. The dataset contained approximately 10,000 rows of pre-cleaned and transformed Excel data. This project focused primarily on data modeling, visualization, and insightful analysis.

**Key Tasks and Methodologies:**

1. **Data Integration and Modeling:**  
   - Imported a pre-cleaned Excel dataset into Power BI.
   - Established relationships between different tables to ensure accurate reporting and analysis.
   - Verified column names and data types to prevent inconsistencies.

2. **DAX Expressions and Calculated Measures:**  
   - Created DAX measures for key business metrics, such as revenue growth, customer retention rates, and product performance.
   - Developed a time intelligence function to compare sales data across different periods.
   - Implemented dynamic measures to allow users to toggle between different KPIs.

3. **Data Visualization and Interactive Dashboards:**  
   - Designed a structured dashboard layout with key performance indicators (KPIs), trend analysis, and comparative charts.
   - Used slicers and filters to enable interactive exploration of business data.
   - Applied formatting and tooltips to enhance report readability.

4. **Performance Optimization:**  
   - Reduced data load time by optimizing queries and using summarized views.
   - Eliminated unnecessary columns and ensured efficient data refresh cycles.

**Outcome:**
This project provided a solid foundation in Power BI, allowing me to refine my visualization and analytical skills. Compared to my latest hospital dataset project, I have significantly improved my ability to handle larger datasets, perform extensive data transformations, and create more advanced DAX measures. This progression showcases my growing expertise in Power BI and my ability to work with complex data structures for meaningful business insights.
